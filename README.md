# ParadiseOS

**Paradise OS** is a project to implement [Paradise](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Paradise) as a file system. It would be distributed as a small disk image, that boots into the Paradise shell, a terminal where a user can **embody vessels**, and **use actions** to create and modify their system, and interact with that of other's.

## Basics
- [Vessels](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Paradise/blob/master/desktop/server/vessel.js) are files.
- [Actions](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Paradise/blob/master/desktop/server/vessel.js) are applications.
- A user controls a vessel.
- Only vessels can act.

## Implementation

- **Kernel**, in progress.
- **Shell**
- **Vessel**
- **Action**
- **Wildcard**
- **Networking**

## Base world

```
the void
  the ghost
```
